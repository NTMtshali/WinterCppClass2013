I chose this design patter because it allow for the expansion of the game. By separating the zombie, player 
and level classes it is possible to expand the functionality of the game. For instance, since the player
class does not accept the input directly it would be trivial to make a two player game, or create a game
that could played via a network or even create NPCS. Each zombie class having it's own ai logic rather than
being centralized within the level class makes it easy to create special zombies. 

When the game is started and new Game instance will be created, the game will display a main menu and 
when the player selects the "start game" option it will call start_loop() which will first create a new player
object, then a level object, then the loop will begin which will do the following:
	Draw the level with the player in it
	Get input from player
	Update position of player/zombies
	Check if the game is over
	Repeat until game is over
 When the game is over the Game object will run the end_game() function which will display the player score
and exit to the main menu.
