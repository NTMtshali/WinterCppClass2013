For my final project I want to create a text based rogue-like game. The game will create a randomly generated "dungeon" draw it to the screen then wait for the player to enter input, change the game state and redraw the screen. The game will have no definitive end but rather will continue until the player dies. The complexity of the game will depend on how much time I am able to put into it. At the most complex, the player would have an inventory, equiped items, different monsters and treasure chests. At the least complex, when the player hits a monster, the player dies.
